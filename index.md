Welcome to my website! Below is a list of apps that I have published to the Microsoft Store.

### 1. [AudioVisualizer](https://anupbdas.github.io/AudioVisualizer.html)
AudioVisualizer is a real-time audio analyzer and visualizer app with a built-in player. It can analyze and visualize audio from its own player, any audio playback device (loopback mode) and from any audio capture device such as a Microphone.

### 2. [ImageShow](https://anupbdas.github.io/ImageShow.html)
ImageShow is a modern GPU-accelerated image and slideshow viewer app. Slideshow of images is generated at run-time with effects, transitions and background music as configured.
